## **üöÄ Getting Started: Setting Up Your Own Version**

Follow these steps to get your own copy of AI Diet up and running.

### **Prerequisites**

* A [Google Account](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://accounts.google.com/signup) to use Firebase and Google AI Studio.  
* Knowledge of how to copy/paste code into a file.  
* A code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**

First, get the code onto your local machine.
 ```
git clone \[https://github.com/YOUR\_USERNAME/YOUR\_REPOSITORY\_NAME.git\](https://github.com/YOUR\_USERNAME/YOUR\_REPOSITORY\_NAME.git)  
cd YOUR\_REPOSITORY\_NAME
 ```
### **Step 2: Set Up Your Firebase Project**

This project uses Firebase for user authentication and data storage.

1. **Create a Firebase Project**:  
   * Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).  
   * Click on **"Add project"** and give it a name (e.g., "My-AI-Diet-App").  
   * Continue through the setup steps.  
2. **Enable Authentication**:  
   * In your new project's dashboard, go to **Build \> Authentication**.  
   * Click **"Get started"**.  
   * Under the "Sign-in method" tab, select **Google** from the list of providers.  
   * **Enable** the Google provider and set a project-facing email, then click **Save**.  
3. **Add Authorized Domains**:  
   * Still in the **Authentication \> Settings** tab, scroll down to the **"Authorized domains"** section.  
   * Click **"Add domain"**.  
   * If you are testing locally, you might need to add localhost. If you have deployed your site (e.g., to GitHub Pages or Netlify), you must add your live URL (e.g., your-username.github.io).  
4. **Set up Firestore Database**:  
   * Go to **Build \> Firestore Database**.  
   * Click **"Create database"**.  
   * Start in **production mode**. This ensures your data is secure.  
   * Choose a location for your database (e.g., us-central).  
   * Click **Enable**.  
5. **Update Firestore Security Rules**:  
   * In the Firestore Database section, click on the **"Rules"** tab.  
   * Delete the existing rules and replace them with the following code. This ensures that users can only read and write their own data.  
   * Click **Publish**.

   ```
      rules\_version \= '2';  
      service cloud.firestore {  
        match /databases/{database}/documents {  
          // Users can only read and write their own document.  
          match /users/{userId} {  
            allow read, write: if request.auth \!= null && request.auth.uid \== userId;  
          }  
        }  
      }
   ```

6. **Get Your Firebase Configuration**:  
   * Go to your **Project Settings** (click the gear icon ‚öôÔ∏è next to "Project Overview").  
   * In the **General** tab, scroll down to "Your apps".  
   * Click the web icon (\</\>) to create a new web app.  
   * Give it a nickname (e.g., "AI Diet Web") and click **"Register app"**.  
   * Firebase will provide you with a firebaseConfig object. **Copy this entire object**.

### **Step 3: Update the Code with Your Firebase Config**

1. Open the index.html file in your code editor.  
2. Find the \<script type="module"\> tag near the bottom of the file.  
3. Locate the firebaseConfig constant. It will look like a placeholder similar to this:

   ``` 
   const firebaseConfig \= {  
       apiKey: "YOUR\_API\_KEY",  
       authDomain: "YOUR\_PROJECT\_ID.firebaseapp.com",  
       projectId: "YOUR\_PROJECT\_ID",  
       storageBucket: "YOUR\_PROJECT\_ID.appspot.com",  
       messagingSenderId: "YOUR\_MESSAGING\_SENDER\_ID",  
       appId: "YOUR\_APP\_ID",  
       measurementId: "YOUR\_MEASUREMENT\_ID"  
   };
   ```
5. **Replace this entire placeholder object** with the firebaseConfig object you copied from your Firebase project dashboard in the previous step. The values (like apiKey, projectId, etc.) will be unique to your project.

### **Step 4: Get Your Google Gemini API Key**

The app requires a Gemini API key for its AI features. This key is stored securely in each user's Firestore document, not in the code itself. You need to generate a key to use the app for the first time.

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).  
2. Sign in with your Google account.  
3. On the left menu, click **"Get API key"**.  
4. Click **"Create API key"**.  
5. **Copy the generated API key** and save it somewhere safe. You will need it the first time you use the app.

### **Step 5: Deploy or Run Locally**

You can now open the index.html file directly in your browser to run it locally. For a better experience, you can deploy it to a hosting service like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.

## **üßë‚Äçüíª How to Use the App**

1. **Sign In**: Open the app and sign in with your Google account.  
2. **Open Settings**: The first time you sign in, the Settings modal will likely appear. If not, click the gear icon ‚öôÔ∏è in the top right.  
3. **Enter Your API Key**: Paste your **Gemini API Key** into the designated field.  
4. **Set Your Calorie Target**:  
   * Use the **Calorie Needs Calculator** to estimate your daily target.  
   * Or, manually enter a **Daily Calorie Target**.  
5. **Save Settings**: Click **Save**. Your settings are now securely stored in your Firebase account.  
6. **Start Logging\!**: Use the chat interface to log your food and exercise. Enjoy your personalized AI diet tracker\!
